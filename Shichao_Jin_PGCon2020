<jpedersen> [Q] Did you explore doing your extension in Rust ?
Answer: <Shichao> I haven/t done that part. The extension is still not mature, we have more work to do in the extension.
<Snow-Man> [Q] Have you tested with v13 and the btree improvements that have been made to it..?
Answer: <Shichao> not checked with v13, you can utilize and look through the benchmark we wrote.
<Shichao> but the problem comes from B+tree itself, which lsm-tree gracefully solves.
