<jpedersen> [Q] Did you explore doing your extension in Rust ?
Answer: <Shichao> I haven/t done that part. The extension is still not mature, we have more work to do in the extension.
<Snow-Man> [Q] Have you tested with v13 and the btree improvements that have been made to it..?
Answer: <Shichao> not checked with v13, you can utilize and look through the benchmark we wrote.
<Shichao> but the problem comes from B+tree itself, which lsm-tree gracefully solves.
<Shichao> benchmark we wrote https://github.com/vidardb/Benchmark
<jpedersen> [Q] Do you see patch using LSM for PostgreSQL/Core ? Or at least contrib?
<mason___> [Q] Can you please explain more about handling concurrent reads and MVCC? Is the sequence number you mentioned a Commit Sequence Number? Or something else?
<Snow-Man> [Q] How does the FDW method get the data into the WAL..?
<jpedersen> [Q] Shichao: my question is about: How much of your extension will you submit to core ?
<russw> [Q] Are there particular use cases where LSM would be better than BTree, or do you think it would always be better?
Answer: Shichao> should be lsm-tree
<Shichao> lsm-tree is definitely better in the data ingestion
<Shichao> in terms of reading performance, depnds on tuning.
<Shichao> additionally, if data fits in ram, lsm-tree would also be good to have.
<Shichao> especially, first time visit without hitting cache
