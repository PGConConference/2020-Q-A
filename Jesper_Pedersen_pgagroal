[Q] What's the difference between pgagroal and pgbouncer\odyssey?

[Q] can -cli or -admin calls be scripted/scraped for monitoring jobs
(exporters/prometheus/etc)

[Q] why can't it do SELECT on a replica?

[Q]  I guess I'm still confused about replica connections. Does pgbouncer
just allow them? PG would enforce them being read-only.

[Q] I had was about how you do pooling. pgbouncer pools by DB+username.
Obviously then this doesn't work well if using dynamic credentials like with
Hashicorp Vault. Does pgagroal do anything differently there that would work
better in this scenario? Or is there no way around DB+username based pooling
since that is what makes a connection?

[Q] Does pgagroal break out the application_name in its metrics? We currently
also patch pgbouncer so we can aggregate connection state by application_name.

[Q] So there's no tracking of application_name?
