[Q] Right now most of the configuration changes, even pg_hba, causes  rolling
     update when pods are restarted. Do you have plans to patch this behavior?
     If no, do you need any help with this?

[Q] upgrading through replica... does that mean the data is duplicated?

[Q] do you have any load balancer like pgpool in front of your replicas or do
    clients connect directly to postgres pods ?

[Q] You talked about a 10% dirty buffer limit that is set at the node level.
    What property controls that? is it a kernel setting or docker/kubernetes
    setting?
